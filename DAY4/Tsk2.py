#Create a class BankAccount that:			
			
#1. Uses a parameterized constructor to initialize account_number and balance			
			
#2. Implements methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount)			
			
#3. Uses a destructor to display a message when the object is deleted			
			
#4. Handle invalid withdrawal using proper checks

# Delete object explicitly
